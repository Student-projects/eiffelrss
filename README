EiffelRSS is an Eiffel library to parse RSS. The goal is to provide
the Eiffel development community with an easy to use and well
structured API for RSS.
  
The distribution also contains a RSS newsfeed reader written with
EiffelVision and EiffelRSS.

EiffelRSS needs ISE Eiffel 5.5 and Gobo 3.3 (comes with ISE EiffelStudio 5.5).
